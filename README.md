This library provides methods for parsing and writing SmileBASIC format files.

## How to use
Review the API documentation that's available, and look at some of the tests that are in use in the project for now. I'll work on writing additional examples soon.

## What uses this?
The SmileInspector project uses this, as well as the latest version of SBAPI, SBAPI XTS (which will be released soon).
