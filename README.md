This library provides methods for parsing and writing SmileBASIC format files.

## How to use
You'll need to install [this package](https://github.com/SBAPI-Team/SmileBASIC-FileParser/packages/779658).
It's currently only submitted to the GitHub Registry, so if you haven't used it before, [follow GitHub's guide on getting set up.](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#installing-a-package)

Why is it only available on GitHub Packages? I just don't want to set up npm stuff for SBAPI projects. Also, just easier to for me to manage, and makes sure people at least know how to read documentation before using this and expecting it to do magic for them.

Review the [API documentation](https://sbapi-team.github.io/SmileBASIC-FileParser/) that's available, and look at some of the tests that are in use in the project for now. I'll work on writing additional examples soon.

## What uses this?
The [SmileInspector](https://github.com/SBAPI-Team/SmileInspector) project uses this, as well as the latest version of SBAPI, SBAPI XTS (which will be released soon).
